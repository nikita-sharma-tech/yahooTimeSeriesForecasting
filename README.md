### Apple Stock Price Forecasting with Prophet
This project uses the Prophet model to predict future stock prices of Apple Inc. by analyzing historical data. 
The goal is to forecast the next 30 days of stock prices while identifying trends and seasonal patterns. 
The project aims to provide insights into stock price behavior, helping make data-driven financial decisions.

1. Project Overview
In this project, we perform the following steps:

- Data Collection: We fetch the historical stock data for Apple (AAPL) from Yahoo Finance.

- Model Training: We use Prophet, a powerful forecasting tool developed by Facebook, to train a model using historical stock price data.

- Prediction: Once the model is trained, it forecasts Apple’s stock prices for the next 30 days.

- Visualization: We visualize the forecasted stock prices, trend, and seasonal patterns detected by the model.

2. The project includes interactive and static plots for:

- Historical Data vs. Predicted Data.

- Trend in stock prices over time.

- Seasonal Patterns like weekly or yearly effects in stock price fluctuations.
  
3. Key Features

- Forecasting with Prophet: Using historical stock data, Prophet models the trend and seasonality in stock prices and predicts future trends.

- Seasonality Analysis: The model detects seasonal patterns, such as weekly or yearly variations, in Apple’s stock price.

- Uncertainty Intervals: The forecast includes uncertainty intervals that show the expected range of future stock prices.

- Visualizations: Beautiful and interactive visualizations using Matplotlib and Plotly to make the results easy to interpret.

4.  Tools and Libraries Used
- Prophet: A forecasting tool by Facebook used to make time-series predictions.

- yfinance: A Python library to download historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.

- Matplotlib: A plotting library to generate static plots for historical and forecasted stock prices.

- Plotly: An interactive graphing library for showing the seasonal components of the stock price.

5. Results
The following visualizations are generated during the project:

-- Forecast Plot: This plot displays the historical stock prices along with predicted future values. It also includes uncertainty
   intervals that help assess the reliability of the forecast.

-- Components Plot: This plot shows the underlying components detected by the Prophet model, including the trend and any seasonal
   effects (e.g., weekly or yearly patterns in stock prices).

6. Insights
By analyzing the forecast and components plots, users can gain valuable insights into:

-- The overall trend of Apple's stock price.

-- Seasonal patterns: Weekly or yearly cycles that could impact stock performance.

-- Uncertainty intervals: A range of potential stock prices for the coming month, helping to gauge risk.
